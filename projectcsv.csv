I've never done any drills, and I only swim freestyle.  The pool is 25 yards (so yes, I end up actually swimming 44 lengths, not 40). I don't flip turn; I push off the wall and streamline to the surface, but I don't dolphin kick.  With all of that in mind my time per 100m is almost exactly 2m, with my 1km time consistently at almost exactly 20m. My strokes per 25 yards is usually 10.

"26","Overtraining...maybe. Looking for someone to shed some light on what I am going through.","5"," It all started back in September, but I won’t bore you with too many specifics. I started noticing practices getting way harder without the actual sets getting harder. My resting heart rate was about 15 bpm higher than normal and BP was very high. During easy sets at practice my HR would go through the roof. My parents took me to get all these tests done: a stress test, EKG, and a ultra sound type thing on my heart. Everything checked out fine. But I didn’t feel fine. I felt exhausted all the time, mentally and physically. I had no other option than to struggle along and push hard through the rest of my senior season.... Now, it has been a month since the State meet where my season ended. For the past month I have been just going home after school and eating Doritos, being lazy. And my resting heart rate in the morning and blood pressure are still very high. It also feels like every now and then I have heavy heartbeats? It’s frustrating and I thought by now, with a whole month of rest that my body should be back to normal. But I’m not, I haven’t seemed to have gotten any healthier. I just hope it is overtraining that I am suffering from and that maybe another month of rest will help.

"40","Earplugs question, should it be this uncomfortable / knack to inserting without creating pressure fullness?","1"," I've always had trouble with my ears (had glue ear as a kid, then a perforated ear drum in right ear which didn't heal so they operated on it with a skin graft, years later they said left one was perforated but nothing was done about it, I presume it healed as that was probably a decade ago but maybe not, it's never caused me a problem so never had it re-checked). I've been casually swimming for exercise for years with my head above water (initially as I was concerned about getting them wet, but then just because as I don't like the feeling of going under and the water rushing into my ears). Water does still splash in my ears but never causes me any problems. I've recently been going more frequently though & want to learn to go underwater and swim properly so that I'm not straining my neck.  To get used to going under the water I've tried using a headband called Ear Band-It with & without silicon putty moldable earplugs. I had some success partially dipping under the water with just the band, but water gets in over the top if I go fully under, leaving me feeling the need to keep lifting the band to let the water out. With the moldable ear plugs inserted, they fit fine but as soon as I get it to seal properly (this is before even going near water) everything is immediately quite uncomfortable in my right ear in which I experience a feeling of fullness and constant loud rumbling sound like it needs to be popped big time (but I don't think it does) the only relief is unsealing the plug slightly to let the air flow and release the pressure – if it's not sealed properly though it's obviously no good in the water, and if it is sealed there's too much unpleasantness, so I gave up trying to use them. My right ear simply feels horrible if I plug it with anything. I even have this problem to a lesser extent when the headband is on tight without the earplugs – it has a pretty good but imperfect seal and can produce quite a pop when I remove it or lift it up to let water out of my right ear.  Finally I tried Mack's AquaBlock earplugs (without headband), somehow I guess it just went in ok that time and wow I was able to swim for about 30 mins and go right down under at the deep end, I experienced really swimming underwater properly and just being down there for the first time in my life, it's amazing and I want to swim like that all the time now! Unfortunately then after a while I adjusted my right ear plug and it got uncomfortable again a bit like the other plugs were in the beginning, and I felt unable to put the plug fully back in, because as soon as it begins to create a seal I feel that uncomfortable air pressure and popping (popping at the seal, I don't mean what you'd think of as popping your ears) and it's just as though my ear is resisting something being in there.  I'm wondering why it worked so well for that period of time and then I really struggled to get comfortable again, is there a knack to the way I put it in that first time to release any air pressure at the same time as it went in? My left ear seems to be happy whatever I do with it really, I can insert & remove plugs any time and can tell that it's sealed but do not hear any of that loud rumbling or popping or discomfort whatsoever. Things are just maybe a little muffled. I think that's how it's supposed to be isn't it? If I put my finger in my left ear it just blocks the sound a bit and feels fine. If I put my finger in my right ear then I feel that slightly rumbling unpleasant pressure inside and then a slight pop when I remove it.  Anyone else experienced this or have any suggestions? Maybe that's just something everyone else puts up with and it's my left ear that's abnormal I don't know!? I tried covering my nose and gently blowing out and swallowing etc in case it's an inner ear pressure thing but I really don't think it is, it didn't change anything except it hurt slightly on my right, and I have no other problems with that ear (as long as I don't stick anything in it!). Maybe I'm just better off somehow getting used to the sensation of water filling it up and emptying again without any protection but I'd rather not :-(",FALSE

I've started to up my training for triathlons, but have been feeling sluggish and crappy towards the end of my longer swim workouts. I think it's primarily due to depleted energy stores - similar to a bonking feeling while running or cycling. Is it appropriate to have an energy gel at the end of the lane and slurp it down in between sets? I know eating in the pool is obviously a no-no, but I was curious what the proper etiquette would be for something like this? For context I swim at a relatively small gym and typically am able to swim with the lane to myself, or split with one person.",FALSE

"45","College Recruiting","7"," Recently I’ve been emailing colleges trying to get my name in their books and talking with them so I can potentially get an offer next year. One thing I’ve run into is that a lot of them have some pretty hefty “qualification times” which it seems that hardly any of their swimmers seem to have. For example, with 3 different universities, their time they gave me in the 50 was faster than all of their swimmers, or a couple, and the ones that had faster swimmers than the time only had seniors that were faster. I’m just curious if they’ll get more lenient going into my senior year, or if they truly won’t recruit me if I don’t have their set time.",FALSE

"50","HR monitoring","1"," A bit of background: my knee’s joint is in pretty bad condition and as per doctor’s instruction I can’t run until the knee is somewhat fixed and probably never again (husband is always optimistic). The sports doctor proposed that I either swim or bike, i chose to swim. I used to run 4 times a week (at leat 7km each time) and for a few weeks I tried to keep my cardio up and in various HR zones as I did for running, also 4 times a week. But the HR sensor of the Garmin Fenix doesn’t work underwater. I unfortunately can’t swim without a (smart)watch as I swim in both a 25m pool 2 days a week and in an Olympic pool 2 other days and have trouble keeping track of the numbers of laps I do (especially in the 25m pool). I can’t check my time of the clock wall as I am short sighted and only see a blur of red dots on a black square and I can’t wear lenses at all. Putting my fingers on my wrist to calculate my HR is therefore rather complicated as I can’t see the clock wall. I’ve seen that Garmin sells Tri and Swim belts but it doesn’t allow the watch to show the HR while training. Then I discovered the Garmin Swim2. Has anyone tested it and recommend it? Is the HR monitor correct? Is there any other watch you would recommend that show HR while you swim without any additional equipment needed? I really need to keep working on my cardio and so far, it feels like it just gets worse as I can’t monitor it correctly in the pool.",FALSE

"52","How should jammers fit ?","3"," Im new to swimming and tried searching on reddit and google for the answer but it seems no one else has the same issue as me. I wanted to hear everyone’s thoughts on how and where the bottom of the jammers should fit. The pair that I bought (Speedo Endurance+) fit perfectly at the waist but end at my knee caps. What I read online is that it should be hard to squeeze in two fingers at the bottom, but because it sits at my knee cap, anytime I bend, it becomes loose. If I pull the jammers up from my knees to above the knee, it’s a more loose everywhere else. I’m worried a lot more water is going to be coming in because it’s loose at the knee. Does anyone else have this problem? Should I just get the square cuts instead due to my height ?

"65","Ugh...","16"," This may come off as a bit of a vent/rant, but this is something that I just wanted to get off my chest Something I don't recall ever mentioning here on this subreddit ever, is that in addition to doing club swimming I also work as a lifeguard, at a different pool than the one I and my team swim are based out of. This particular pool I work at is a lap pool, intended for lap swimming, but is relativley small and a lot of people come in and go to cassually lap swim throughout the day, and there are a handful people who come in every single day. In particular there is this one woman who always comes in at exactly 8:30 AM. I completley understand everbody who swims is at a different level and moving at their own pace, and while I may judge silently I still respect people trying to get into physical shape. However sometimes having bad technique can actually be disruptive for people around you, esspecially if its a bad flipturn. The way this particular woman flipturns, she turns completley upside down with her legs straight up in the air, pauses, and then lets her legs drop violently back into the water, creating a massive splash. Its less of an actual flipturn and more of a handstand, brief pause, and angry leg whip. I get sprayed with droplets of water onto me on the lifeguard chair, so I have started walking around just to avoid getting wet everywhere.I don't think she even is aware of how violent it is, because she is always listening to music with her MP3 player.  And its not just me who is annoyed by this. The people she ocassionally shares the lane with and people in the neighboring lanes visibly flinch. I don't want to be rude and tell her that her technique could be improved, but at the same time its getting really annoying and its actually started making me a wee bit angry.",FALSE

"75","Swimming training advice","2"," Hello everyone! I’m currently a junior in high school and I have this goal in mind to make it to the varsity level swimming team early senior year, the problem is I haven’t swam in like 6 years :/ So the last time I swam competitively was in the 4th and 5th grade and I REALLY enjoyed it. I quit it in middle school because my coach wanted me to continue on to a higher league where they practiced a lot more hours mornings and nights, and I wasn’t ready to commit to that. But now that I’m in high school and ready to move onto college I want to go back into some kind of sport, and swimming is really the only one I enjoyed out of all of the ones I’ve played. So the reason I haven’t started swimming again now or earlier is because I’m just too busy to go to the public pool 10-15 min away. But I’m planning on “practicing” this summer break, which is like 3 months or so. So I guess my question is this: *is three months not enough to be able to get back into the right shape? *The varsity team at my school is not necessarily THAT competitive, there isn’t even a JV team at my school. I feel like I have the technique down but I just need to work on my endurance and physical shape.

"83","Question on floating from a beginner.","7"," Backstory : As I child I went for swimming classes, but didn't really fare too well. By the time I was 13 I had 3 bad incidents with water and I kinda just stayed away. There's always a sense of panic when I'm in the water but only if my feet can't touch the ground (doesn't have to be always touching I can bob, but as long as I touch it every few secs I'm OK) Fast forward twenty years, and I've decided to enrol for swimming classes. From memory, I know I had difficulty in coordination with my legs and hands and Ive always felt my legs just start to sink from the waist below no matter what. Anyways, we were practising floating (face down and up) and in both forms I just couldn't stay star shaped with my waist and legs along the surface. It would eventually sink and my feet would hit the floor, and as I exhaled into the water (face down only), my upper torso would eventually sink as well. Now to my actual question. If I completely empty out the air in my lungs, without any vertical movement, should I sink or float? I ask this because if I completely empty out my lungs I can literally lie flat on the floor of the pool for however long until I need to come up for air. Like I wanna know if I'm at a physiological disadvantage? For reference I'm 180cm 90kgs with 22% BF. I am 100% certain this composition is different above and below the waist as most of my fat is around my stomach. I could get a DEXA scan done if it would help answer some questions. I have a much easier time floating in the sea due to density etc. But even there I don't think I'm completely flat on the surface. Well I need to double check, I'm just too scared of drifting away from shore and my feet won't be able to touch the ground. Thanks for reading! Edit: I'm a 33y old M",FALSE

It is hard to count his strokes because every 3rd stroke he glides forward with his left or right arm stretched out ( depending on if it's his return lap or not ) his face out of the water for air but uses the arm on the side that he is getting air from to pull twice.

"134","Kicked out of meet, scratch rule!?","3"," Hi, my recently turned 13 year old son was kicked out of a swim meet yesterday because he missed his finals heat. I guess this is known as the scratch rule. If you miss a finals race you are kicked out of the entire meet. This is the first time in so many years of swimming and LOTS and LOTS of meets that he has ever missed a race. First time. It was an honest mistake, I’m sure many people know the situation, the turnaround was tight, he had just swam the 200 fly and was warming down, thought he had time, went to get a drink of water and then it was too late. Obviously he shouldn’t have missed his race. I am wondering about this rule and the purpose behind it. I am having a hard time understanding how the punishment fits the crime. He’s a kid, he has worked really hard all season and just made a mistake. Now he is incredibly sad, feels terrible, can’t make his cuts for states and feels like he wasted his whole season. We, as parents are out a lot of money on the hotel this weekend, gas for driving 100’s of mile to this meet, cost for food, all the time spent organizing schedules to accommodate rides/work etc for the rest of the family at home...all wasted because a new teen made an honest mistake. It feels like there might be a better, more fitting, punishment for a kid who screws up. Anyone familiar with this policy and why it came to be? What ultimate purpose is it serving? I can’t think of a rule in any sport of any age that feels this extreme. No warning, nothing. This feels like something that would be saved for a kid who did something really bad, like yelled at a ref or purposely did harm to another swimmer, or negatively affected another swimmers race. Once again, he should not have missed his race but maybe taking away one race, or giving a warning or something other than...get out, go home and don’t come back. Thanks for any thoughts/insight on this",FALSE
"135","Fantastic end to an Amazing Season!","6"," Just got done with State Championships for my Junior year in HS, and man was this a great season! Had some killer time drops this year: a total of 14 seconds in my 100 breast for a 1:03.88 and almost 20 seconds in my 100 free for a 54:17! To be completely honest I have no idea how I managed to improve so much, but I'm really thankful for my amazing coaches and my teammates for encouraging me the whole way! Ended up 24th in the 100 Breast at State, Really happy with how far I've come, and excited for how far I'll go next year. I'm finally joining my first club team this spring, and I'm really excited for championships a year from now! thanks for taking the time to read this, I know its not as fast as some people on this sub but I just have to brag a little bit bc I'm so happy!",FALSE

"151","Lane Sharing AITA?","0"," I'm somewhat new to swimming in a pool, and there is no posted etiquette on lane sharing at my pool. Today I had someone ask me to share my lane for the first time. The lanes at this pool already feel small, I'm on the larger side (6'0) and I am mixing in breaststroke and backstroke into my swim, so I told the guy I wasn't really comfortable sharing the lane. Then the guy insists that I have to share the lane and jumps in anyway. Why bother asking my permission if you're just going to ignore my preference anyway? So I ended up hopping out and waiting for another lane to empty out because I didn't feel like swimming with that pushy jerk. Anyway, r/swimming am I the asshole?",FALSE

"158","I have a story about a kid on my team","149"," One day, about two months into the season, this one kid (let's call him Fred) came up to me and asked me if it was okay if he joined the swim team.  He's a junior, same as me.  Never swam in his life.  Slightly overweight and he wanted to get into better shape.  He's also really soft spoken and kinda shy.  I told him sure, gave him the head coach's number, and went about my day. Fred showed up to practice that day wearing basketball shorts.  He apparently did not own a single swim suit.  Regardless, he hopped into one of the lanes and one of our coaches began working with him.  He eventually got a practice suit and was so proud of it when he showed it off.  It was black and orange, looked really awesome. Fred did not swim in the first meet.  Or the second.  Or the third.  A lifeguard almost had to pull him out.  But Fred kept trying.  Finally, he had his chance to swim in a meet in the 50.  He swam a 45.  No flip turn, barely put his head underwater.  But he was super happy and everyone was really proud of him. As the season went on, Fred kept dropping time.  And it wasn't in any small amounts.  The second meet he did, he dropped 5 seconds in the 50.  On his first time doing the 100 free, he got a 1:38.  By the end of the season, he had a 31 in the 50 and a 1:20 (I think) in the 100. What's the point of this story?  I dunno, to be honest.  I guess the biggest point is that if you don't know if you can do well in a meet or drop any time, you can.  Sure, you may have a bad meet or swim.  But that's just one out of many.  Fred had never swam in his life, not even lessons.  And he did very well during the course of the season. You can do it. Now go swim 3 miles (4.8 kilometers if you're using the metric system) in open water.",FALSE

"165","I am getting old and as a non swimmer I would like to be in the peak stamina and swimming form in my life. What distance target should I set for this year?","6"," I am a 29 year old Bangladeshi guy. I really love swimming but I never got the opportunity for proper training. There were no coaches and there was no lane management but I managed to learn some very basic swimming skills by reading books and youtube. I only had 40 minutes or so in the water every weekend at 12am with people almost drowning you by not following proper lane etiquette. I could swim 3km in the pool without getting my feet down although I did have to pick up my breath while lying on the side. Although I still cant tread water efficiently for more than half a minute (my eggbeater and breaststroke kicks are useless for treading). That was 3 years ago. Keep in mind thst I did have a coach but he was only interested in teaching basics to new swimmers. And there are no structured coaching systems in place that will train you to be an athlete. Now I see that I am getting old and tired. I cant even walk a flight of stairs without panting. I would like to get the best stamina in my life and be in the best in swimming form in my life before I get old and more out of shape. This is not a competition among others but something like a get into the best shape of your life of sorts. I am out of home for 14hr 5 days a week Sun to Thurs. I recharge on Friday so I will be able to attend the 40 minutes (its one hr but 20 minute is getting ready and down and 20 minute is getting up) on every Saturday at noon from now till November. I was wondering what would be a realistic goal to set for the end of the year. That is how far in distance should I set a target? 3 km, 5km? I am more interested in distance than in speed.",FALSE

Like i'm really grateful for that coach. So for the first time in my life, i had to do underwaters and i just... don't ...understand them?! She was dealing with other lanes while i executed the set that had them and didn't think about it until after i was back home lol I know the theory and how it is a LOT faster, but i'm wondering if anyone can deconstruct it for a beginner like me. How do you start doing them and figure out your breathing, body movement, etc",FALSE
